# MentalHealth java console that use hash structure 

The Mental Health Hash application is a simple Java console-based program designed to manage and track the mental health states of students and yet effective, solution for tracking students wellbeing.

# What it can do:

1.Add Students: Adds John(Good) and Felix (Average) to the system.
2.View All Students: Displays both students and their mental health states.
3.Search Student: Retrieves the mental health state of John.
4.Update Student: Changes John's state from Good to Poor.
5.Remove Student: Deletes Felix from the system.
6.Exit: Ends the program.

I made this application because the concept of tracking student's mental health state is relevant and socially significant topic.
It contributes to me it is because it deepens my understanding about the code and also promotes the mental health awareness especially to students that are struggling within the campus community.
